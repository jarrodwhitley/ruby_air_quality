# Air Quality Checker

This is a simple air quality checker app for me to learn Ruby on Rails 8. This app uses the airnow.gov API. The API doesn't cover all zipcodes, mostly just major cities. There are some quirks with the API. For example my zipcode (75068) doesn't return any data, but the city right next to me (Frisco, TX 75068) does. 

Working zipcode examples:
- 75067 (DFW)
- 80014 (Denver)
- 39530 (MS Gulf Coast)
